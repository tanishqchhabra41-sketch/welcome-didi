<h1>Welcome Home Dolcy 💖</h1>

<p>
It has been a whole year without you.<br><br>

The house felt quieter.<br>
The jokes weren't the same.<br>
Even the food didn’t taste as good 😭<br><br>

We are proud of everything you achieved.<br>
But we are even happier that you're back.<br><br>

Canada is amazing...<br>
But nothing beats HOME 🏡❤️<br><br>

Welcome back to your people,<br>
Your room,<br>
And your chaos 😂

</p>
